# MusicQ

<p>2023 Quantum Hackathon Korea</p>

<p><Strong> Topic </Strong></p>



<p><Strong> What is the Qmuvi </Strong></p>
<p>=> By transforming quantum circuits into music videos, it allows you to <b>"hear" and "see"</b> how a quantum state evolves as it is processed by a quantum algorithm.</p>

<p> topics presented at the competition </p>
<p>1. Operation of noise errors, application of autoencoders to eliminate noise errors, resulting in sound comparison and circuit disclosure</p>
<p>2. Theory and code of how mathematical formulas turn into music</p>
