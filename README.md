# MusicQ

<p>2023 Quantum Hackathon Korea</p>

<p><Strong> Topic </Strong></p>

Let's listen to the difficult quantum circuits, let's listen to the noise-free circuits, and compare them, and let's look at the mathematics

<p><Strong> What is the Qmuvi </Strong></p>
<p>=> By transforming quantum circuits into music videos, it allows you to <b>"hear" and "see"</b> how a quantum state evolves as it is processed by a quantum algorithm.</p>

<p> topics presented at the competition </p>
<p>1. Operation of noise errors, application of autoencoders to eliminate noise errors, resulting in sound comparison and circuit disclosure</p>
<p>2. Theory and code of how mathematical formulas turn into music</p>

<p>As the title was posted on the GitHub file, we uploaded files about the song status without noise, the song status with noise, and the song status with a quantum auto encoder. And on Jupiter's laptop, you can also check the code for the results of learning it. Each file also includes a code, so please understand as you watch it.</p>
